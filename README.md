Ready to take your learning journey to the next level? **FlashCard** marries the efficiency of
flashcards with the engaging, accessible format inspired by TikTok, making it easier and more fun to
absorb knowledge on any topic, anytime, anywhere.

### The FlashCard Experience

We believe in learning without limits. That's why FlashCard utilizes the fascinating collections
from **[The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API](https://metmuseum.github.io/)** to deliver
rich, educational content across a variety of subjects. But why stop there? **We're inviting you to
bring your own flashcards to life.** With our local import feature, you can customize your learning
experience with personal or curated content, ensuring that what you learn is exactly what you need.

### Why FlashCard?

In a world where information overload is the norm, FlashCard stands out by making learning:

* **Efficient**: Snapping scroll behavior allows for quick navigation through flashcards, making it
  easier to find and focus on the concepts that matter most to you.
* **Accessible**: Designed with a mobile-first approach, access your flashcards anytime, anywhere â€“
  be it on your commute, during a break, or in a cozy corner of your home.
* **Engaging**: Taking cues from TikTok, FlashCard makes learning as addictive as scrolling through
  your favorite videos, turning every swipe into a step towards knowledge.
